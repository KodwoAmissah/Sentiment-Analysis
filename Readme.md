# ðŸš€Fine Tuning a Pre-trained Model to Predict The Sentiment Covid-19 Vaccine TweetsðŸš€

## Project Objective

The objective of this  is to fine-tune a pre-trained model to determine the sentiments of a Twitter post whether positive,neutral or negative.

## What you will find in this repository

- The source code can be found in the src folder
- The needed CSV files can be found in the dataset folder
- The Notebook folder contains the Notebook I used for my EDA and a comparison of the model
- I used the Virtualevn Python environment

### Manual Setup

For manual installation, you need to have [`Python3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system.Then you create a virtual environment and install requirements.txt file

- Windows:

        python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

 Run the streamlit app (being at the repository root):

- Sreamlit:

  - src

          streamlit run src\Home.py
